# Examples of TinyML applications using TFLM

**[Tensorflow Lite for Microcontrollers](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers) (TFLM)** is a framework that is a subset of Tensorflow which is designed to execute machine learning models on resource constrained devices i.e. microcontrollers. 

The follow repository will provide anyone the ability of executing TinyML applications using TFLM on Renesas's industry leading [RA family](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/ra-cortex-m-mcus) line of ARM based microcontrollers.

For every example, there will be an instruction set on how to execute the example with the given device. 

**Note** Currently, the hello world example have been ported to the EK-RA6M4 board but can also easily be ported on other RA family boards as well.

## Ported examples
The examples provided in this repository is shown in table below.
