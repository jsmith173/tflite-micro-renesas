# Examples of TinyML applications using TFLM

**Tensorflow lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM)** is a framework that is a subset of Tensorflow which is designed to execute machine learning models on resource constrained devices i.e. microcontrollers. 
The follow repository will provide anyone the ability of executing TinyML applications using TFLM using Renesas's industry leading [RA family](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/ra-cortex-m-mcus) line of ARM based microcontrollers.
