# Examples of TinyML applications using TFLM

**Tensorflow lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM)** is a framework designed to be a subset of Tensorflow which is design to execute machine learning models on resource constrained microcontrollers. 
The follow repository will provide anyone the ability of executing AI applications using TFLM using Renesas's industry leading [RA family](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/ra-cortex-m-mcus) line of ARM based microcontrollers.
